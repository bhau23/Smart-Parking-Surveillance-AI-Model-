# Smart Parking & Surveillance AI Model Challenge Status

## Task Completion Status

### Task 1: Vehicle Detection in Parking Spaces ✅
- **Status**: Completed
- **Achievements**:
  - Implemented hybrid detection system combining computer vision and deep learning
  - Achieved 97.47% accuracy (exceeds 90% requirement)
  - Successfully detects occupied and empty parking spaces
  - Interactive Streamlit UI for real-time monitoring
  - [Demo Video](validation_results/streamlit-app-2025-04-10-04-04-64.webm) showing UI functionality
  - Clean code implementation with comprehensive documentation
  - Full validation framework with ground truth comparison
  - Detailed performance metrics and analysis

### Task 2: Deployment Demonstration on Edge Devices ⏸️
