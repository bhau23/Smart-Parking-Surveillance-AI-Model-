## Confusion Matrix Analysis
```
              Predicted
Actual    Occupied  Empty
Occupied     264     10
Empty          0    122
```

2. **High Precision**: Only 10 false positives out of 396 total spaces
3. **Space Classification**:
   - 264 spaces correctly identified as occupied
   - 122 spaces correctly identified as empty
   - 10 spaces incorrectly marked as empty
   - 0 spaces incorrectly marked as occupied

## Validation Requirements
✓ Accuracy > 90% requirement met
✓ Correct parking space counting
✓ Reliable occupancy detection

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Processing Speed**
   - Current: 0.61 FPS
   - Target: >1 FPS for real-time monitoring
   - Potential optimizations:
     * Batch processing of frames
     * GPU memory optimization
     * Resolution/processing trade-offs

2. **False Positives**
   - 10 spaces incorrectly marked as empty
   - Could be improved with:
     * Fine-tuning confidence thresholds
     * Enhanced shadow/lighting handling
     * Additional training data

## Conclusion
The system meets and exceeds the core accuracy requirements for reliable parking space detection. The main focus for improvement should be processing speed optimization for real-time applications.
