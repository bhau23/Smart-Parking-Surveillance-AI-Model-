# Smart Parking & Surveillance AI Model Challenge Submission

## Project Overview
This submission implements two major components of the challenge:
1. Smart Parking Detection (Task 1)
2. Fall Detection System (Task 3)

## Task Completion Status

### Task 1: Vehicle Detection in Parking Spaces ✅
- **Implementation**: Hybrid approach combining computer vision and deep learning
- **Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 97.47% (exceeds required 90%)
  - Precision: 92.42%
  - Recall: 100.00%
  - Processing Speed: 0.61 FPS
- **Demo**: [Streamlit UI Demo](validation_results/streamlit-app-2025-04-10-04-04-64.webm)
- **Documentation**: [Validation Results](validation_results/analysis.md)

### Task 2: Edge Device Deployment ⏸️
- Not implemented due to hardware constraints
- Architecture designed with future edge deployment in mind

### Task 3: YOLO Extension for Action Detection ✅
- **Implementation**: Custom YOLO model for fall detection
- **Location**: D:/fall_detection/
- **Demo**: [Fall Detection Demo](D:/fall_detection/demo.mp4)
- **Features**:
  - Human action recognition
  - Real-time fall incident detection
  - Successful testing with demonstration scenarios
